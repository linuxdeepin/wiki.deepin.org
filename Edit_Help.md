## Edit Rules

The first rule for encyclopedia editors is to be bold and then modify encyclopedia. Other people can correct any mistakes you made, so have confidence and try! Wikipedia page editors have a variety of editorial conventions, rules and philosophy, but be bold is one of the most important rules!

Editors can provide information about the entire new paragraph or page, or as simple as repairing misspellings or spelling errors. In general, try to add or edit text to make it clear and concise. The most important thing is to make sure you are improving the encyclopedia to make it more accurate.

When you need to use a certain type of format, for example for new or bold text, you can use the markdown syntax or edit the buttons in the edit toolbar above the area.

## Edit the Summary
Before saving your changes, you can enter short comments in the Summary box that describes the changes. Do not think too much, just simply describe what you have just changed. For example, you might say "fixed spelling errors" or "add more relevant information".

This summary is stored with your editors and allows people to more effectively track changes in Wikipedia.

## Preview
It would be a good idea to use the "Show Preview" button to view your changes before saving. This is also related to tracking changes, because each time you save, it will be displayed as a separate change to other people. Do not worried here too much, but there is a good habit of removing errors in your own work by using the preview before saving, rather than saving, and then having to do another edit just to make one or more minor fixes.

## Show changes
Another option is the "Show Changes" button, which allows you to see the difference between the current version and the edited version.

## Other types of editing
Using wiki editing, you can start a new page, move (or rename) a page, or even delete a page.

Remember that you should always aim to improve the overall content of your encyclopedia with your editors.

## Discussion
Each article has its own "conversation page" where you can ask questions, make suggestions, or discuss corrections.
