## Introduction

Display manager, also known as login manager, provides a interface for users to input their user name and password. When account authetication is successful, it starts a session (window manager or desktop environment), such as GNOME shell, KDE Plasma or Deepin desktop environment.

A graphics server can only be managed by one display manager in one time. This, however ,does not prevent several display managers to be installed in one system.

## Types of display manager

There are many kinds of display manager, for example:

- LightDM: default display manager used by deepinn and Ubuntu
- GDM：default display manager used by Gnome desktop environment
- SDDM: default display manager used by KDE Plasma desktop

## Settings

deepin offers LightDM as its default display manager. If you want to change it to another one, please follow the instruction below.

### The first method

When installing display manager, a dialog will be shown to let you choose preferred display manager. Press TAB to choose one you would like to use, then Enter.

### The second method

Launch the terminal, then execute:

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm  # You can change  "gdm" to any other display manager you like
