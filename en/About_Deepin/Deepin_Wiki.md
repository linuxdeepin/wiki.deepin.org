# Introduction

 > Deepin community official wiki website for sharing the relevent technique of Deepin and Linux.
 
&emsp; The Deepin Wiki collects various information like experience of developing, system using  as well as helpful tips, then shares them to users.You can also have your own contribution here!
&emsp; This is wiki content synchronization repository. The website content between https://wiki.deepin.org and https://github.com/linuxdeepin/wiki.deepin.org perform **two-way synchronization** every five minutes.
&emsp; Synchronization includes wiki page content, page information, publish status, and media resources, excluding page scripts and styles.

# Catalogue Structure

- /en/ wiki contents in English 
- /zh/ wiki contents in Chinese

# Discussion

&emsp; Each article has its own "conversation page" where you can ask questions, make suggestions, or discuss corrections.

# Contribution

You can submit contributions in two ways.

1. Edit via website

    wiki.deepin.org is built using wikijs, with an easy-to-use interface and simple operation logic. We are currently recruiting contributors, welcome to [click here](https://wiki.deepin.org/zh/%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8EDeepin/Deepin_Wiki/%E5%8F%82%E4%B8%8E%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA) to submit your contributions. 

2. Submit via git

    We recommend submitting contributions via git when multiple contents need to be imported or moved due to the inperfect function of batch operation in wikijs.

# Edit help
&emsp; The first rule for encyclopedia editors is to be bold and then modify encyclopedia. Other people can correct any mistakes you made, so have confidence and try! Wikipedia page editors have a variety of editorial conventions, rules and philosophy, but be bold is one of the most important rules!

&emsp; Editors can provide information about the entire new paragraph or page, or as simple as repairing misspellings or spelling errors. In general, try to add or edit text to make it clear and concise. The most important thing is to make sure you are improving the encyclopedia to make it more accurate.

&emsp; When you need to use a certain type of format, for example for new or bold text, you can use the **markdown syntax** or edit the buttons in the edit toolbar above the area.

## Edit methods

1. Click the "Page Actions-->Edit" tab at the top of the page.
2. Modify the text content in the editors.
3. Click the "Save" button at the top of the page.

## Edit the Summary

&emsp; Before saving your changes, you can enter short comments in the Summary box that describes the changes. Do not think too much, just simply describe what you have just changed. For example, you might say "fixed spelling errors" or "add more relevant information".
&emsp; This summary is stored with your editors and allows people to more effectively track changes in Wikipedia.

## Preview

&emsp; It would be a good idea to use the "Show Preview" button to view your changes before saving. This is also related to tracking changes, because each time you save, it will be displayed as a separate change to other people. Do not worried here too much, but there is a good habit of removing errors in your own work by using the preview before saving, rather than saving, and then having to do another edit just to make one or more minor fixes.

## Show changes

&emsp; Another option is the "Show Changes" button, which allows you to see the difference between the current version and the edited version.

## Other types of editing

 Using wiki editing, you can **start a new page, move (or rename) a page, or even delete a page.**

> Remember that you should always aim to improve the overall content of your encyclopedia with your editors.
