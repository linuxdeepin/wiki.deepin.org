## Hardware compatibility
Check operability of hardware and register it in the Deepin database by [[Hardware Probe]].

## UEFI mode, and can not find Windows startup items after the installation 

This problem occurs because Windows did not successfully write its startup entry to your motherboard, but instead it uses UEFI's fallback mode to boot (via EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi).

At this point, if you installed other systems, and it has successfully written the info to the motherboard chip, the motherboard will ignore the fallback mode. This can cause the result that the Windows startup item cannot be found.

You can manually add a boot entry for Windows in the terminal, here assuming that your EFI/ESP partition is located in /dev/sda2:

$ sudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 2 -L "Windows Boot Manager" -l \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi

Where "-d /dev/sda" specifies the hard disk path; "-p 2" specifies the partition number is 2; '-L "Windows Boot Manager"' specifies the name of the boot entry; "-l \\EFI\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi" specifies the path of efi firmware.
